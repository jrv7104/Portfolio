This is my second attempt at an updated portfolio page. My main focus was updating the page with the projects and a couple of homework assignments I accomplished. It was neat to see it grow with content that I did (with some help from others of course), and it was a reminder of how far I've come and how much more I can do.

The main projects is the myDaily page that I did with a group and the Board Game Sommelier project. The former is a page that provides a quick daily news brief with weather, some fun facts and the news. The latter allows board game fans to register, select board game mechanics they don't like, and when several users come together for a game night, the feature will use the selected filters and provide a few recommendations the entire group can enjoy.

I retained my quiz generator, weather forecast, password generator and daily work planner homework assignments. All of those have respective readme files.

Another big change is the color scheme, and I feel like it is a more cohesive and professional look. I also added an images folder for a little more organization.
