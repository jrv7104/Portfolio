This is an updated portfolio page. My main focus was updating the page with the project and a couple of homework assignments I accomplished. It was neat to see it grow with content that I did (with some help from others of course), and it was a reminder of how far I've come and how much more I can do.

The main project is the myDaily page that I did with a group. It is a page that provides a quick daily news brief with weather, some fun facts and the news.

I also added my quiz generator, weather forecast, password generator and daily work planner. All of those have respective readme files.

Changes will be made as time goes on. Possible changes include additional work content and a design update.
