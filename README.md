This is an updated portfolio page. My main focus was updating the page with the project and a couple of homework assignments I accomplished. It was neat to see it grow with content that I did (with some help from others of course), and it was a reminder of how far I've come and how much more I can do.

The main project is the myDaily page that I did with a group. It is a page that provides a quick daily news brief with weather, some fun facts and the news.

I also added my quiz generator, weather forecast, password generator and daily work planner. All of those have respective readme files.

I also added screenshots of my old portfolio page. I wanted to show how much of a difference there has been in terms of design and work in only a few weeks.

Changes will be made as time goes on. Possible changes include additional work content and a design update.
